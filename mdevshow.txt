                             Program MDEVSHOW
                              19 March 2020

Show all the MDEV state visible from the current directory, resolve
dependencies, and show all the resulting data.

This program can be useful for checking the MDEV files in the current
directory, and in all the directories referenced from those.  It also
shows the data that is used as part of the automatic MDEV build process,
and can be useful for debugging problems with that process.

See the MDEV documentation file for a overview of the MDEV mechanism.  See
the MDEV_FILE documentation file for details of the MDEV file format.
